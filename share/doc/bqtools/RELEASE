       New:  temperature = 10.0 12.0 14.0
    -Sequence of numbers:
       Old:  temperature = 10 : 2.0 : 14
       New:  temperature = $(seq 10 2.0 14)
    -Values from file (one value per line):
       Old:  temperature = load temp.txt  
       New:  temperature = $(cat temp.txt)

### Removed
- Torque scheduler support removed
- User commands removed:  bqsub, bqdel, bqstat, bqparam, bqsub_accumulator,

  keysList and valuesList support multi-variables single loop):
     -param1 = (temperature,pressure) = [(10.0,101), (12.0,102), (14.0,103))]
     -param1 = (temperature,pressure) = [(10.0:2.0:14.0, 101:1:103)]
     -param1 = (temperature,pressure) = load temp.txt
     -param1 = (temperature,pressure) = load temp.txt, pres.txt
